# Optimize.AI-Next-Best-Action-Prediction

# Product Overview
A deep learning based solution that analyzes event (e.g. loan approval process) log data with contextual information (e.g. loan request parameters, etc.) and predicts the next step and time to next step for an open request within a process. With process execution data stored in form of event logs, an AI based operations planning system can help in understanding future system state based on current state and business context. This solution improves business operations planning by reducing cost and improving efficiency through dynamic resource planning.

# Product Highlight
* The solution takes operational log data as input and provides the answers of these questions: o What is the next possible step/request of a given sequence? o What is the approximate time to the next step? The solution provides the mechanism to train as well as test on user data. This allows for the flexibility to build and predict on user specific process data. The solution is divided into two parts: 1. Process specific training API to capture process behavior 2. Prediction API to predict the next step and time to next step
* From a process manager perspective, next best action prediction can be highly useful for resource planning which can help achieve better throughput rate and time at a lower cost. The solution can be applied to various industries like banking, logistics, insurance etc. and processes such as loan approval process, order fulfillment process, procurement process etc.
* Mphasis Optimize.AI  is an AI-centric process analysis and optimization tool that uses AI/ML techniques to mine the event logs to deliver business insights. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch
